Single configuration source
---------------------------
In order to scale AutoBuild to multiple machines, there needs to be
centralized configuration management.

Currently, each AutoBuild instance uses its own configuration file from disk.
This file is read in by auto-build.pl and then the values are passed into the
creation of AutoBuild.pm.
