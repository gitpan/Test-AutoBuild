--------------------

 * Do not fail build engine if SCM checkout fails
 * Fix fcntl() locking on BSD & Solaris (add missing format string
   to pack when create struct data). (From Tobias Nijweide)

v1.2.0: (21-08-2006)
--------------------

 * Completely modular build workflow engine to allow the operation
   of the builder to be extended & customized at will
 * Extract changelogs since last build cycle for most repository
   types
 * Addition of Mercurial repository type
 * Lock file can now be obtained using Fcntl to allow reliable
   operation over NFS

   via an external system. Implementations for monitoring via process
   command name, FIFO pipe, and log4perl output

 * Expose more environment variables to build control file 
 * Pass through a temporary filename to build control file to allow unit
   test results to be captured.

   arbitrary metadata, and files. Multiple archives can be saved over

 * Allow for arbitrary test scripts to be run independantly of the
   main build control file
