=head1 NAME

Test::AutoBuild::Repository::SVK - A repository for SVK (Distributed Subversion)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::AutoBuild::Repository::SVK


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a repository implementation for the
SVK revision control system, a distributed implementation
of Subversion. It will automatically import remote repositories
it uses into a local repository with a name matching the
module name. It has full support for detecting updates to
an existing checkout.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Example configuration entry for SVK module looks like

  svk = {
    label = SVK
    module = Test::AutoBuild::Repository::SVK
  }


A module's paths entries either contain the full path
of the remote repository in which case it will be
imported into a local repository with the same name
as the module. If the two arg form is used, the second
arg will be used as a subdirectory of the module


 myapp = {
    label = CCM Core
    paths = (
      http://svn.example.org/svn/trunk
      http://svn.example.org/other/trunk -> other
    )
    repository = svk
    group = Software
 }

In this example, the following commands will be run
to process the module

   svk import //myapp http://svn.example.org/svn/trunk
   svk sync //myapp

   svk import //myapp/other http://svn.example.org/other/trunk
   svk sync //myapp/other

   svk checkout //myapp myapp
   svk chcekout //myapp/other myapp/other
