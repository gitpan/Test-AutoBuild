# Before we get started, a word about timezone handling...
#
# According to the perforce docs
#
#   "Date and time specifications are always interpreted
#    with respect to the local time zone of the Perforce
#    server. Note that because the server stores times
#    internally in terms of number of seconds since the
#    Epoch (00:00:00 GMT Jan. 1, 1970), if you move your
#    server across time zones, the times recorded on the
#    server will automatically be reported in the new
#    timezone."
#
# Sounds reasonable, right ?
#
# Yes, if that's what it actually did, life would be
# golden.
#
# But...its broken. It does indeed report times in the TZ
# that the server is currently using, however, it applies
# a DST offset based on the DST value at the time the
# changeset was committed! So, if you're server is say in
# Boston, mid-April - thus EDT - and you're quering a change
# that was made in Jan - when EST was in force, then rather
# than reporting the time in EDT, it adjusts for DST and
# reports it relative to EST.
#
# Things get even more fun, if your client is in another
# timezone, say you're in London. At the time London is on
# BST, your server is EDT - so simply have a delta of 5
# hours to worry about. Bzzzt. No, that change from mid
# Dec is still being reported in EST, 4 hours difference.
#
# While you can figure out what the server's current time
# zone is from 'p4 info', you cant reliably infer what the
# timezone was back in Dec from this info - so states may
# do the EST<->EDT switch, others may be on EST all year
# around. So, basically the date / time from 'p4 changes'
# or 'p4 describe' is useless in itself.
#
# Now fortuntely, p4 does actually store times internally
# as seconds since the epoch. So rather than passing a date
# to the p4 sync command, we run 'p4 -ztag changes' to find
# out the timestamp associated with each changelist. Then
# sort them & find out the most recent changelist, and then
# explicitly sync to that.
