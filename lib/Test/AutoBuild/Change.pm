package Test::AutoBuild::Change;

use strict;
use warnings;

use Class::MethodMaker
    new_with_init => "new",
    get_set => [qw(number date user description files)];


=item my $change = Test::AutoBuild::Change->new(%params);

Creates a new change object, initializing with a set of
named parameters. The C<number> parameter is a number
representing the change, typically either a plain integer,
or a version string (ie set of period separated integers).
The C<date> parameter specifies in seconds since the epoch,
date the change was made. The C<user> parameter is a
representation of the user who made the change, typically
their username. The C<description> parameter provides the
log message for the change. Finally the C<files> parameter
is an array reference listing all the files affected by
the changelist.

sub init {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->number(exists $params{number} ? $params{number} : die "number parameter is required");
    $self->date(exists $params{date} ? $params{date} : die "date parameter is required");
    $self->user(exists $params{user} ? $params{user} : die "user parameter is required");
    $self->description(exists $params{description} ? $params{description} : die "description parameter is required");
    $self->files(exists $params{files} ? $params{files} : die "files parameter is required");
}

=item my $number = $change->number();

Retrieves the number associated with this change. This is

Retrieves the date on which the change was made. This is

Retrieves the user who made the change, typically the username
under which the repository was accessed.
