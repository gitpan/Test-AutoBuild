=head1 NAME

Test::AutoBuild::Lock - Manage a lock file to prevent concurrent execution

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::AutoBuild::Lock


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module takes out an exclusive lock on a file, preventing
multiple instances of the builder running concurrently against
the same build home. The scheme to use for locking the file, can
be one of C<flock>, C<fcntl>, or C<file>. C<fcntl> is preferred
since it works across NFS. If this isn't supported on the OS running
the builder, then C<flock> should be used. As a last resort the C<file>
method should be used, with does a simple file presence/creation check,
although if the builder fails in a bad way it is possible the lock will
not be cleaned up correctly.

package Test::AutoBuild::Lock;

use warnings;
use strict;
use IO::File;
use Class::MethodMaker
    new_with_init => 'new';
use File::Spec::Functions qw(catfile);
use Fcntl qw(:flock F_SETLK F_WRLCK);
use POSIX qw(:unistd_h :errno_h);


use Log::Log4perl;

=item my $stage = Test::AutoBuild::Lock->new(file => $lock_file_path,
					     method => $lock_method);

Creates a new lock manager, for the file specified by the C<file>
parameter. This should be a fully qualified path for the file to be locked.
The file does not have to exist beforehand, but the path must be writable
by the user running the build instance. The C<method> parameter should be
one of the strings 'fcntl', 'flock' or 'file' designating the method used
to acquire the lock.

=cut

sub init {
    my $self = shift;
    my %params = @_;

    $self->{file} = exists $params{"file"} ? $params{"file"} : catfile($ENV{HOME}, ".build.mutex");
    $self->{method} = exists $params{"method"} ? $params{"method"} : "fcntl";
    $self->{lock} = undef;
}

=item my $status = $lock->lock;

Attempt to acquire the lock, returning a true value if successfull,
otherwise a false value to indicate failure (due to the lock being
held by another process).

=cut

sub lock {
    my $self = shift;
    my $log = Log::Log4perl->get_logger();

    #----------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Grab the global build lock.

    }
}


sub DESTROY {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->unlock();
}

=item $lock->unlock;

Release a lock previously acquired by the C<lock> method. If a
lock is not explicitly released, it will be unlocked during
garbage collection (via a DESTROY method hook on this object).
