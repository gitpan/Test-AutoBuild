Test::AutoBuild::Archive - archival of files and metadata

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $manager = [...get instance of Test::AutoBuild::ArchiveManager...]
  my $archive = $manager->get_current_archive;

  my %orig_files = (
    "/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/noarch/autobuild-1.0.0-1.noarch.pm" => ...metadata...
  );

  # Save status of the 'build' action for module 'autobuild-dev'
  $archive->save_data("autobuild-dev",
		      "build",
		      "success");

  # Save list of packages associated with module 'autobuild-dev'
  $archive->save_files("autobuild-dev",
		       "packages",
		       \%orig_files,

			 base => "/usr/src/redhat"});


  # Retrieve status of the 'build' action for module 'autobuild-dev'
  my $status = $archive->get_data("autobuild-dev",
				  "build");

  # Retrieve metadata associated with saved files
  my $metadat = $archive->get_files("autobuild-dev",

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Test::AutoBuild::Archive> module provides an API for
associating chunks of data and files, with objects, persisting
them to some form of storage. Each object in the archive is
uniquely identified by an alphanumeric string, and can in turn
contain many storage buckets, again uniquely identified by an
alphanumeric string. An individual bucket can store a chunk of
metadata, and a set of files at any one time. Each file stored
can also have a chunk of associated metadata. Conceptually the
organization of an archive is thus

=item $archive->save_data($object, $bucket, $data);

Save a chunk of data C<$data> associated with object C<$object>
into the storage bucket named C<$bucket>. Both the C<$object>
and C<$bucket> parameters must be plain strings comprising
characters from the set 'a'..'z','A'..'Z','0'-'9','-','_'
and '.'. The C<$data> can be comprised scalars, array references
and hash references. Code references and file handles are forbidden.
If there is already data present in the bucket C<$bucket> associated
with the object C<$object> then an error will be thrown. The data
can later be retrieved from the archive by calling the C<get_data>
method with matching arguments for object and bucket.

    $self->_save_metadata($object, $bucket, "DATA", $data);
}

=item $archive->save_files($object, $bucket, $files, $options)

Saves a set of files C<$files> associated with object C<$object>
into the storage bucket named C<$bucket>. Both the C<$object>
and C<$bucket> parameters must be plain strings comprising
characters from the set 'a'..'z','A'..'Z','0'-'9','-','_'
and '.'. The C<$files> parameter should be a hash reference where
the keys are fully qualified file names, and the values are arbitrary
chunks of data, comprised of scalars, array references and hash
references. Code references and file handles are forbidden. If
there are already files present in the bucket C<$bucket> associated
with the object C<$object> then an error will be thrown. The data
can later be retrieved from the archive by calling the C<extract_files>
method with matching arguments for object and bucket. A listing of
files stored in the archive can be retrieved by calling the method
C<get_files> with matching arguments for object and  bucket.
The C<$options> parameter controls the way in which the files
are stored. It can contain the following keys

=over 4

=item link

Attempt to hardlink the files into the archive, rather than
doing a regular copy. In combination with same option on the
C<extra_files> and C<attach_files> methods, this allows for
considerable conversation of disk space, by only ever having
one copy of the data no matter how many locations the file
is kept. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that the contents
of the original file is not modified after the archive is saved.
If omitted, defaults to 0.

=item move

Delete the original file after copying it into the archive.
This can also be used in combination with the C<link> option
as protect. If omitted, defaults to 0

=item base

When storing the filenames, trim the directory prefix specified
by the value to this option, off the front of the filenames to
form a relative filename. This can be useful when later extracting
the files back out to an alternate directory. If omitted, defaults
to the root directory.

=item flatten

When storing the filenames, trim off the entire directory prefix,
only maintaining the basic filename. If two files have the same
filename after trimming, an error will be thrown. If omitted, defaults
to 0.

=back

This method returns a hash reference, whose keys are the filenames
saved, relative to the value associated with the C<base> key in
the C<$options> parameter.

=item $archive->_save_metadata($object, $bucket, $datatype, $data);

This an internal method to be implemented by subclasses, to
provide the actual storage for metadata. The C<$object> and
C<$bucket> parameters are as per the C<save_data> or C<save_files>
methods. The C<datatype> parameter is a key, either C<DATA>
to indicate general metadata being saved, or C<FILES> to indicate
the per file metadata. Finally, the C<$data> parameter is the
actual data to be saved, which may be a scalar, hash reference or
array reference, nested to arbitrary depth. Implementations must
throw an error if the archive already contains data stored against
the tuple (C<$object>,C<$bucket>,C<$type>).

=item my $copied = $archive->clone_files($object, $bucket, $archive, $options);

This method copies the files associated with the object
C<$object> in bucket C<$bucket> in the archive C<$archive>
over to this archive. If the C<link> key is specified as
an option, then implementations are free to implement this
as a zero-copy operation to save storage. This method returns
a hash reference whose keys are the list of filenames, relative
to their original base directory, and whose values are the
metadata associated with each file.

=item $archive->_persist_files($object, $bucket, $files, $options);

This an internal method to be implemented by subclasses, to
provide the actual storage for metadata. The C<$object> and
C<$bucket> parameters are as per the C<save_data> or C<save_files>
methods. The C<$files> parameter is a hash reference detailing the
files to be persisted. The keys of the hash reference are filenames
relative to the directory specified by the C<base> key in the
C<$options> parameter. The C<$options> parameter can also contain
the keys C<link> to indicate zero-copy persistence of files, and
C<move> to indicate the original file should be deleted.

is sorted alphabetically.

C<$object> is not stored in this archive, then the empty
list is to be returned. This method must be implemented
