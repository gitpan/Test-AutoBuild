 Test::AutoBuild Installation
 ============================

Install the perl modules in the usual MakeMaker way:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make sysconfdir=/etc install

While it can run as any user, the recommended approach for 
setting up automatic unattended builds is to create a dedicated 
(unprivileged) user account. By convention this is called 
'builder' with a home dir of '/var/lib/builder'

  # useradd -d /var/lib/builder builder
  # auto-build-make-root /var/lib/builder
  # chown -R builder.builder /var/lib/builder

Once this is complete, edit the file /etc/autobuild/autobuild.conf
to suit your environment & modules. The build can be invoked as the
builder user, thus
   
  # su - builder
  $ autobuild.pl --config /etc/autobuild/autobuild.conf


More details on installation can be found in the manual page for
the Test::AutoBuild module
