 Test::AutoBuild Installation
 ============================

Install the perl modules in the usual MakeMaker way:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make sysconfdir=/etc install

While it can run as any user, the recommended approach for 
setting up automatic unattended builds is to create a dedicated 
(unprivileged) user account. By convention this is called 
'builder' with a home dir of '/var/builder'


  mkdir /var/builder
  mkdir /var/builder/{build-home,build-root,build-cache}
  mkdir /var/builder/{public_html,public_ftp}
  mkdir /var/builder/packages
  mkdir /var/builder/packages/{rpm,zips,tars}
  mkdir /var/builder/packages/rpm/{BUILD,RPMS,SPECS,SOURCES,SRPMS}
  mkdir /var/builder/packages/rpm/RPMS/{noarch,i386,i486,i586,i686,sparc}

  useradd -d /var/builder builder

  chown -R builder.builder /var/builder

Once this is complete, edit the file /etc/autobuild/autobuild.conf
to suit your environment & modules. The build can be invoked with
   
   autobuild.pl --config /etc/autobuild/autobuild.conf


More details on installation can be found in the manual page for
the Test::AutoBuild module
